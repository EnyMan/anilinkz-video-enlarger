# anilinkz-video-enlarger

Adds buttom to vide pages that lets you anlarge the videos for better wieving pleasure.
By default it enlarges the video 2.25 times = the video is 125% bigger (thus better right?).

Any suggestions are welcome.
Also if you feel it can be done better feel free to make a pull request

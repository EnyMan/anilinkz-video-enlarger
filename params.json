{"name":"Anilinkz video enlarger","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome\r\n\r\nI am anime fan and i've been watching anime for good 7 years now lately i stumbled upon webpage called anilinkz.com.\r\nAnd i loved that page, but after few weeks i got kinda frustrated with the small video player, i know its part of the site design and small screens, so i decided to make my life a bit easier by making script that would make the video player a bit bigger. And so here it is :)\r\n\r\n### Anilinkz video enlarger\r\nAdds button to video pages that lets you enlarge the videos for better viewing pleasure. By default it enlarges the video 1.5 times = the video is 50% bigger (thus better right?).\r\n\r\nAny suggestions are welcome. Also if you feel it can be done better feel free to make a pull request","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
